      "full": "The Chipekwe is a large, rhinoceros-like aquatic cryptid reported in the swamps and rivers of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Described as hippo-sized with a single prominent horn, smooth skin, and aggressive territorial behavior, the Chipekwe has been part of Central African oral traditions for centuries. Unlike the more famous Mokele-mbembe, which is often described as dinosaur-like and elongated, the Chipekwe is consistently portrayed as a robust, horned creature resembling a water rhinoceros. Indigenous communities view it with deep respect and fear, considering it a dangerous guardian of sacred waterways. The creature's description—a large aquatic mammal with a single horn—has led to speculation about surviving prehistoric mammals such as Arsinoitherium or unknown rhinoceros species adapted to aquatic life. Skeptics suggest the reports arise from aggressive hippopotamus encounters or cultural memories of extinct megafauna. With approximately 150 documented accounts spanning from pre-colonial times to the present, the Chipekwe represents an important aspect of Central African traditional knowledge and cryptozoological investigation."
