      "full": "The Chipekwe is a cryptid reported by indigenous communities in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo for centuries. Described as a large aquatic creature resembling a rhinoceros with a single horn, smooth or lightly haired skin, and aggressive behavior toward boats and humans entering its territory. Unlike the more famous Mokele-mbembe, which is often described as sauropod-like, the Chipekwe is consistently described as rhinoceros-like in appearance and behavior. Local traditions hold deep respect for these creatures, viewing them as dangerous but important spiritual guardians of waterways. Reports persist into modern times, with sightings continuing in remote swamp regions of the Congo Basin and Zambezi River system."
